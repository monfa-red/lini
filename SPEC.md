# Lini — Language Specification

A small, human-readable language for plain-text diagrams. Flex/grid layout,
composable nodes, CSS-driven theming — compiles to clean SVG.

**Two brackets and one capsule carry the whole language.** `{ … }` is **style** —
`key: value;` declarations, dash-case, space-separated, exactly like CSS. `[ … ]`
is **content** — a node's children, in source order. `|…|` is **identity** — a
node's type and id. A node is `|type#id| "label" .class { style } [ children ]`;
every part but the bars is optional. Nothing styles outside a `{ }`; nothing is
drawn outside the canvas.

**Two node kinds, like HTML.** A **box** is a drawn node (`|block|`, `|box|`,
`|oval|`, `|group|`, …) and may hold children; a **string** is text *content*
inside or beside one. `"…"` is text, exactly as it sits inside an element on a web
page — stylable in place (`"x" { color: red }`), but a leaf, never a box.

This document is complete: an implementer can build a conforming engine from it
alone. **Link** routing has its own contract — see [`LINKING.md`](LINKING.md).

## Quickstart

```
cat -> dog -> bird
```

That's a complete diagram: three boxes, two links. Lini fills in the rest.

| Form | Means |
|---|---|
| `\|type#id\|` | **Identity** — a type, an optional `#id`. Always in bars: an **instance** (`\|oval#cat\|`), a **rule** (`\|oval\| { … }`), a **define** (`\|cat::oval\| { … }`). |
| `"…"` | The **label** — what the node is called, placed by its type (text, a caption, a symbol). |
| `{ … }` | A **style block** — `key: value;` declarations. |
| `[ … ]` | A **content list** — a node's children. |
| `.name` | A **class** — define it (`.hot { … }`), wear it (`\|box\| .hot`). |
| `#name` | An **id** — declare it (`\|box#cat\|`), select it (`#cat { … }`), reference it bare (`cat -> b`). |
| `--name` | A themeable **variable** (`fill: --accent`). |
| `a -> b` | A **link**. |

Three defaults make small diagrams trivial:

- Omit the type → `|box|` (a rounded, framed card); `|#cat|` is a default box.
- Omit the label → the box is empty.
- Name an undeclared id in a link → it's auto-created as a labelled `|box|` (`cat -> dog` adds `|box#cat| "cat"`).

**A file has three parts, in order: the stylesheet, the canvas, then the links.**
The stylesheet is one `{ }` block at the top — setup that draws nothing. After it
come the instances, then the links:

```
{                                               // the stylesheet — setup only
  layout: grid;  columns: repeat(3);  gap: 30;  // scene config
  |box| { radius: 6; }                          // a rule — style every box
  .hot { stroke-width: 2; }                     // a class
}

|box#server| "Server"                           // the canvas, two instances
|box#client| "Client"
server -> client "requests"                     // a link, with a label
```

## 1. Mental Model

A Lini file is the body of an implicit **root** container: a **stylesheet** of setup
first, then the drawn **canvas** instances and **links** in source order — and every
statement is exactly one of the three:

| Part | Holds | Drawn? |
|---|---|---|
| **stylesheet** | one `{ }` block: scene config (incl. link & routing defaults), rules, classes, defines | no — it styles |
| **canvas** | instances — boxes (`\|type#id\|`) and text (`"…"`) | yes |
| **links** | `a -> b` connections | yes |

The "is this drawn or styled?" question never arises: **styling lives in the
stylesheet block; drawing lives on the canvas.**

**One character tells a statement's kind.** A leading `|` opens a node, a `"`
opens text, a bare name opens a link, and inside the stylesheet a `.`/`#`/`|…|`
opens a rule. There is no prescan, no ambiguity.

**Two brackets and one capsule, one meaning each.**

- `|…|` — **identity**: a type and an optional `#id`. The *only* place a type
  lives — on an instance (`|box#cat|`), a rule (`|box| { }`), or a define
  (`|treat::box| { }`).
- `{ … }` — **style**: `key: value;` declarations. The *only* place styling lives.
- `[ … ]` — **content**: a node's children (boxes and text), then its internal
  links, in source order.

A drawn node is `|type#id| "label" .class { style } [ children ]`. Only the bars
are required; everything after is optional. A link is the same tail on a different
head: `a -> b "label" .class { style } [ labels ]`.

**Three sigils, one meaning each.**

- `|…|` — a **type** (with an optional `#id`). Always in bars.
- `.name` — a **class**: a worn style bundle. Defined `.hot { … }`, worn after the
  identity (`|box| .hot`, `a -> b .hot`) — never inside the bars.
- `#name` — an **id**: a node's unique name. Declared in the bars (`|box#cat|`),
  selected as a rule (`#cat { … }`), referenced **bare** in a link (`cat -> b`).

A name goes **bare only when referenced**, and the one thing you reference is an
**id** (you link to it). Types and classes are never linked, so they are always
sigil-marked.

**Boxes and text.** A *box* has a type, an id, classes, a style block, and
children. A *string* is text content — no identity or children, but it **may carry
a style block** (`"x" { color: red; translate: 0 -6 }`). A string in a box's `[ ]`
(or trailing the head as its label) is that box's text; a string on its own is a
free-standing text node. Text is a leaf: to give it children, a border, padding, a
`pin`, or a wirable id, put it in a box (a `|block|` is the minimal one) — exactly
like wrapping a web page's text in an element.

**The file is the root container.** The stylesheet `{ }` is the root's own setup
block; the canvas instances are its children (written bare — the file *is* its
`[ ]`); the links are its internal links. Scene properties (`layout`, `gap`,
`padding`, `fill`, `font-size`, `link`, `routing`, …) sit in that block;
inheritable ones (`font-*`, `color`, `link`, `clearance`, `routing`) cascade to
every node and link.

**Render order is source order; the cascade is whole-file.** Instances draw in the
order written (later on top, pinned children above the flow; `layer:` overrides),
and every rule applies to every instance. Links are the one thing that needs no
declaration: naming an id declared nowhere auto-creates it ([§3](#3-statements)).

**Two kinds of variable.**

- *Visual* values that don't affect layout — colours and the font family — are
  exposed as live CSS variables (`--lini-fill`, `--lini-accent`, …) so a host page
  can re-theme them, and each colour carries a built-in dark variant that follows
  the viewer's OS or a `data-theme` toggle ([§12.1](#121-visual-variables-live-themeable)).
- *Layout* values — sizes, gaps, paddings, widths, **and font size** — bake into
  the SVG as literals. Text is measured at compile time, so its size can never be a
  runtime `var()`; a standalone SVG always looks right.

## 2. Lexical Syntax

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Extension | `.lini` |
| Encoding | UTF-8 (BOM ignored) |
| Line endings | LF or CRLF (normalized on read) |
| Comments | `// …` to end of line. No block comments. |
| Statement end | A node/link/text statement ends at a newline or `;`. A **declaration** ends at `;` — its value runs to that `;` (or a closing `}`), so a value may span lines. |
| Identifier | `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` — case-sensitive, ASCII, dash-case |

Whitespace is insignificant except as a token separator and where a rule below
says otherwise:

| Form | Whitespace rule |
|---|---|
| `\|…\|` | Identity in bars: a type, an optional `#id` (`\|box#cat\|`), or an id alone (`\|#cat\|`). `::` is the define operator (`\|cat::oval\|`). Bars are paired; surrounding space at the boundary is not allowed. |
| `#id` | Inside the bars it names the node's id; at a rule's head it is an **id selector** (`#cat { }`). A `#` followed by hex digits in a *value* is a colour (`#f80`); the two never meet — one heads a statement or sits in bars, the other is a value. |
| `key: value` | `:` separates name and value; surrounding space optional, canonical is one space after (`radius: 5`). |
| `a:side` | A `:` after a link endpoint forces a side (`a:left`). Distinct from the declaration `:` by position — it follows an endpoint, never opens a value. |
| `.name` (class) | At a rule head it is a class **selector** / definition (`.hot { … }`). On an instance or link it is a **worn class**, following the identity — **spaced** off it (`\|box\| .hot`, `a -> b .loud`), the rest of the chain **glued** (`.hot.loud`). |
| `id.child` | **No space** — an endpoint path into a child (`kitchen.bowl`). |
| `--name` | A variable, in a value or at a statement start to declare one. |
| link op | `[marker?] line [marker?]`, glued, no internal space (`->`, `--->`, `<->`). |
| `[ … ]` | A content list. Paired; whitespace inside is insignificant. |

**Strings** — double-quoted UTF-8: `"…"`. Escapes: `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`. A
double-quoted string is always text; leading and trailing whitespace in its value is
**trimmed** (`" ABC "` is "ABC", and a spaces-only `" "` becomes `""`), so source
spacing never leaks into the render.
Single quotes are **not** strings (reserved, [§19](#19-reserved-words)).

**A bare word is an identifier, never a string.** In a value, an unquoted word is
always an identifier — a keyword, a colour or `symbol` name, a `font-family`, or an id
reference — so literal **text** is always quoted: a string-valued property (`title`,
`href`, `src`, `path`) takes a `"…"` even with no spaces. The one hybrid is a name that
may contain spaces — `font-family` — bare or quoted, quoted only when needed
(`font-family: "SF Mono"`), as in CSS. Numbers and `` `…` `` expressions are bare too;
only text is quoted.

**Expressions** — a backtick region `` `…` `` is a **compile-time math expression**:
operators and the math library, folded to a literal number (or a point) at compile
time. It is the **only place operators appear** — outside it `-` is a link line and
`<` / `>` are markers. Self-delimiting like a string, and may span lines
([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)).

**Numbers** — integer or decimal, optional sign, no units (px for lengths, degrees
for angles, 0–1 for opacities/fractions). `10`, `-5`, `0.25`, `+3`. A trailing `%`
makes a **percentage** (`50%`), valid only in colour components.

**Values are space-separated and positional**, like CSS: `padding: 5 2 5 5`,
`shadow: 2 2 4 #0003`, `translate: 10 -4`, `columns: 80 140 80`. A **comma**
separates list items and appears only where a property takes a list of groups
(`points: 0 0, 10 10`). **Functions** use parentheses and sit in value position —
`rgb(…)`, `hsl(…)`, `repeat(…)`, the math library, and any you define
([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)); a call needs no backtick (only an operator does).

**Colors** — `#fff`, `#f80c`, `#ffaa00`, `#ffaa00cc` (3/4/6/8 hex digits; the 4-
and 8-digit forms carry alpha), CSS names (`red`, `cornflowerblue`), `rgb(…)`,
`rgba(…)`, `hsl(…)`, `hsla(…)` (percentages allowed — `hsl(200, 50%, 50%)`),
`oklch(L, C, H[, A])` (the palette's own space — L/A in 0–1, C the chroma, H in
degrees; folded to a hex at compile time, so it renders in every target), a
`--name` variable reference, or `none`. Out-of-range channels are an error. Beyond
a flat colour, a **paint** (`fill` / `stroke` / `link`) may be a **gradient** —
`gradient(…)`, `linear-gradient(…)`, or `radial-gradient(…)`
([§12.3](#123-gradients)); the built-in hue palette ([§12.2](#122-the-colour-palette))
is reached through ordinary `--name` references.

## 3. Statements

A file is **stylesheet → canvas → links** ([§1](#1-mental-model)), and a
container's body nests the same idea: a `{ }` style block, then a `[ ]` of children
and internal links.

### The stylesheet

One `{ }` block at the very top of the file — optional, omitted when there is
nothing to set up. Unlike an ordinary style block (declarations only), it is the
root's setup block, so it additionally holds the file-global definitions:

| Item | Form | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Scene config | `layout: grid;` | a declaration on the root |
| Link / routing defaults | `link: #666;` `routing: orthogonal;` | declarations that cascade to every link ([§9](#9-links)) |
| Variable | `--brand: #f60;` | a themeable visual variable (colour / font) |
| Function | `scale(n) …` | a reusable compute function — a backtick body ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)) |
| Rule | `\|box\| { … }` | style every box (an element selector) |
| Descendant rule | `\|table\| \|box\| { … }` | style every box inside a table |
| Class | `.hot { … }` | define class `hot` |
| Id rule | `#hero { … }` | style the one node with id `hero` |
| Define | `\|treat::box\| { … }` | a new type `treat`, base `box`, with its defaults |

```
{
  gap: 16;  fill: --bg;  link: #666;
  --brand: #ff6600;
  scale(n) `100 * 1.2^n`;
  |box| { radius: 6; }
  .hot { stroke-width: 2; }
  |treat::box| { radius: 5; }
}
```

`|treat::box|` reads "treat **is a** box"; the `::` sets a define apart from a
plain reference (`|box|`) at a glance. Defines chain (`|panel::treat|`) and may
carry intrinsic children ([§9](#9-links)). Max inheritance depth 16; cycles are an
error.

### Node declaration

```
|type#id| [ "label" ] [ .class… ] [ { style } ] [ [ children ] ]
```

The **bars are identity** — a type and an optional `#id`. The **`"label"`** is the
node's name; the **`.class`es** are worn styling; the **`{ }`** is style; the
**`[ ]`** is content. Only the bars are required; at least a type or an `#id` must
sit inside them.

A node's **type and id live in the bars**, its **classes follow** them:
`|oval#cat|`, `|box| .hot` (a box with class `hot`), `|box| .hot.loud` (two
classes), `|#cat|` (a default box with id `cat`).

```
|cyl#db| "Postgres" .primary { fill: #eef } [
  |badge| "v16"
]
```

| Form | Effect |
|---|---|
| `\|box#cat\|` | a box, id `cat` (empty — no label). |
| `\|treat#cat\|` | type `treat`, id `cat`. |
| `\|treat#cat\| "Friendly cat"` | + label "Friendly cat". |
| `\|treat#cat\| { fill: red }` | + a style block. |
| `\|box#cat\| ""` | same as `\|box#cat\|` — `""` is just an empty string. |
| `\|box#cat\| .bold.loud { padding: 5 }` | type + id + classes + own style. |
| `\|group#garden\| { … } [ … ]` | container with style and a body. |
| `\|box\| "Load balancer"` | anonymous labelled box (can't be linked to). |
| `\|#cat\|` | a default `\|box\|`, id `cat`. |

### The label

A node has **no label unless you give it one** — a bare `|box#cat|` is an empty box
(the `#cat` is a handle, like HTML's `id=`, not text):

| Label | Means |
|---|---|
| no string at all | nothing — an empty box |
| `"X"` | the label "X" |
| `""` | an empty string — nothing in flow, an empty cell in a grid ([§5](#5-layout)) |

A link to an *undeclared* name still draws a labelled box: `cat -> dog -> bird`
desugars to three boxes labelled "cat"/"dog"/"bird" ([Implicit nodes](#implicit-nodes)). A multi-word label needs no `[ ]`: `|box#lb| "Load balancer"`; an
*anonymous* labelled box needs no id: `|box| "Load balancer"`.

**The label is smart — each type places it.** The same `"X"` does the most useful
thing for the shape it sits on:

| `"X"` on | becomes |
|---|---|
| `\|box\|` and the shapes (`\|oval\|`, `\|hex\|`, `\|cyl\|`, `\|diamond\|`, …) | its centred text |
| `\|group\|` / `\|table\|` | its **caption** ([§8](#8-templates)) |
| `\|icon\|` / `\|sign\|` | its **symbol** — `\|icon\| "heart"` is `\|icon\| { symbol: heart }` |
| a **link** | a label along the route ([§9](#9-links)) |

Because a group's label is its caption, `|group#kitchen| "Kitchen" [ … ]` needs no
hand-written `|caption|`; because an icon's label is its symbol, `|icon| "bell"`
needs no `{ symbol: … }`. Give no label and a type places nothing — one rule, no
per-type exception.

**The label takes no style of its own.** The `{ }` after the head is the *node's*
block, so a styled or nudged label rides the `[ ]` content form instead, where each
string is a leaf in its own right ([Text content](#text-content)):

```
|box#api| "API" .hot { fill: red }        // label + class + the node's own style
|box#api| [ "API" { translate: 0 -6 } ]   // a styled label, via content
```

**The label and `[ ]` coexist.** The label is the node's one inline item, lowered by
its type — a text or caption child prepended to the `[ ]`, or (for `|icon|`/`|sign|`)
the `symbol` — and the `[ ]` holds the rest:

```
|group#kitchen| "Kitchen" [ |box#bowl| "Bowl" ]   // caption + a child
|icon| "bell" [ "3" ]                              // symbol + a text badge
```

One inline label only — two or more strings go in the `[ ]`.

### Text content

A string is a **text node** — always a `<text>` leaf, never wrapped:

- In a box's `[ ]` (or as the box's label) it is that box's text — centred when it
  is the only in-flow child, else a flow child laid out by the box's `layout`.
- On its own (on the canvas, or in a `[ ]`) it is a free-standing flow / canvas
  text node.
- Several strings are several text nodes — `"a" "b" "c"` is three (a string is
  self-delimiting, so no `;` is needed between them).
- An empty `""` is suppressed (adds no text) — except as a **grid cell**, where it
  holds its track ([§5](#5-layout)).
- Multi-line text uses `\n`; the box sizes to the widest line, with a
  `font-size × 1.2` leading between lines (plus any `line-spacing`).

A string carries **no children** — text is a leaf, not a box — but where it is
**content** (free-standing, or a child in a `[ ]`) it **may carry a style block** of
text properties: `"X" { color: red; font-weight: bold; translate: 0 -6;
rotate: 12 }`. Only text-valid properties apply (colour, every `font-*`, `opacity`,
`letter-spacing`, `line-spacing`, `text-transform`, `text-decoration`, `translate`,
`rotate`, `layer`); any other — `pin`, `padding`, `width`, a border, children, even
`href` / `title` — needs a real box, so wrap the text in a `|block|`. Set on the
string the style applies to it directly; set on a containing box it cascades down
([§11](#11-properties)). A string in the **label** position is the one place it is
not content but a shorthand for it, so it takes no style block — write it in `[ ]`
to style it (above).

### Implicit nodes

A link endpoint that is a **single bare id** not present in the link's **scope**
auto-creates the node `|box#cat| "cat"` in that scope — a box named `cat`, labelled
"cat" — so `cat -> dog -> bird` is a complete three-box diagram. The same holds inside
a container body: a body link auto-creates its missing endpoints among that body's own
children. Declaring the id in the scope — before or after the link — uses it instead
of creating one. A **path** endpoint (`kitchen.bowl`) is never auto-created: it must
resolve to an existing node, or it is an error. If a same-named node exists elsewhere
in the tree, the box is still created here and a warning names the other match.

### Declarations

A declaration `key: value;` lives only in a `{ }` style block — the stylesheet
(configuring the root) or a node's own block. Property names are dash-case; values
are space-separated and positional. A declaration **ends with `;`** — its value runs
to that `;` (or the block's closing `}`), so a value may span several lines (a long
expression, a per-segment list); the `;` is optional only immediately before `}`. A
bare `key: value` outside a `{ }` is an error. See [Properties](#11-properties).

---

## 4. Selectors & the Cascade

A **rule** is `selector { declarations }`. A selector is one or more
space-separated **units**; the space is the descendant combinator. A unit is a type
`|box|` (with an optional `#id`, `|table#main|`), a class `.hot`, or an id `#hero`:

```
|box| { … }              // every box (element selector)
.hot { … }               // every node with class .hot
#hero { … }              // the one node with id hero
|table| |box| { … }      // every box inside a table (descendant)
.sidebar |box| { … }     // every box inside a .sidebar
|table| .hot { … }       // every .hot inside a table
```

A **descendant selector** matches a node whose ancestor chain contains each unit in
order (not necessarily adjacent), exactly like CSS's descendant combinator. Every
construct keeps its sigil — `|box|`, `.hot`, `#hero` — so a selector reads as a run
of marked units; a bare word is never a selector.

A type's class never glues into its bars (`|box.hot|` is rejected): a class is
**worn**, not part of identity. To match boxes-with-a-class, style the class
(`.hot { … }`); to match within one, use a descendant (`.hot |box|`).

A **define** introduces a new type from a base: `|treat::box| { … }`. Its
declarations are the type's defaults; an optional `[ ]` gives it intrinsic children
(materialized per instance — see [§9](#9-links)).

A **class** is defined by `.name { … }` and **worn** by writing it after the
identity (`|box| .hot`) or after a link's endpoints (`a -> b .hot`) — the same
`.class` slot on both, never inside the bars.

**Selecting vs. drawing is decided by the section, not the syntax.** `|box| .hot`
in the stylesheet is a descendant *rule* (.hot inside a box); on the canvas it is
an *instance* (a box wearing .hot). One reads as a selector, the other draws —
because rules live in the stylesheet and instances on the canvas.

**Specificity** — most specific wins, ties break by **source order** (the CSS
cascade): type rule < descendant rule < class < id rule < the instance's own block.
[§13](#13-specificity) gives the full tiering — the type cascade, links, and how
complex values merge.

## 5. Layout

A container picks an engine with `layout`, and a flow's orientation with `direction`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `layout: flow` | 1D flex. `direction: row` runs horizontally, `direction: column` (default) vertically. |
| `layout: grid` | 2D grid — sized by `columns` / `rows`. |
| `layout: sequence` | Time axis — participants across the top, messages top-to-bottom in source order ([§10](#10-sequences)). |

`direction` is `row` or `column` (default `column`) — the same property a chart uses
to orient its plot, where it also takes `radial` ([CHARTS.md](CHARTS.md)). `chart` /
`pie` (data plots) and `sequence` ([§10](#10-sequences)) are separate engines — `chart` /
`pie` via their templates, `sequence` via its `layout` or the `|sequence|` template
([§8](#8-templates)).

**Defaults:** every container — the root included — defaults to `layout: flow`
with `direction: column` and `gap: 20`. The default `|box|` pads its content by 20; so does the root, and
its padding is the margin that frames the whole rendered scene — links and labels
included — out to the SVG edge. The frameless `|block|` / `|row|` / `|column|` pad
by 0 (see [§8](#8-templates)).

### Flex — `align` / `justify`

Flexbox model: `justify` runs *along* the flow (main axis), `align` runs *across* it
(cross axis). Both default `center`.

| Value | `justify` (main axis) | `align` (cross axis) |
|---|---|---|
| `start` / `center` / `end` | pack at the edge / centre / opposite | align each child to the edge / centre / opposite |
| `stretch` | fills children to span the main axis | each child's **box** fills the cross axis |
| `evenly` | equal gaps between and around children | (treated as `center`) |

`stretch` fills the child's **box**, not its *content* (placed by the child's own
`align`/`justify`, also `center`). `evenly` needs multiple children.

All of `align`/`justify`/`stretch`/`evenly` are **no-ops unless the container is
larger than its packed children** — an auto-sized container has no slack to
distribute. Slack comes from an explicit `width`/`height`, or a grid's fixed
tracks.

### Grid — `columns` / `rows` / `cell` / `span`

A grid is sized by its track lists:

| Property | Notes |
|---|---|
| `columns` | **Required.** A track list — `columns: 80 140 80` (3 fixed), `columns: repeat(3)` (3 auto), or a mix (`auto 40 auto`). The list length is the column count. |
| `rows` | Optional. Same form. A floor, not a cap: extra children flow into implicit auto rows. Omitted → all rows implicit, count `⌈children / columns⌉`. |
| `cell` | A **box** child's placement `column row`, 1-indexed (`cell: 2 1`). |
| `span` | A **box** child's span `columns rows`, default `1 1` (`span: 2` = `2 1`). |

A **track** is a size (`80`), `auto` (sized to its widest/tallest child), or
`repeat(N)` / `repeat(N, size)` for many equal tracks. The count comes from the
list length.

**Auto-flow.** Children without `cell:` flow left-to-right, wrapping at the column
count; a `cell:` pins one explicitly and the rest flow around it. Bare-text cells (a
table) are pure auto-flow — `cell:` / `span:` apply to **box** children only (a text
node has no block to carry them). A grid is positional, so an empty `""` cell is
**kept** — it holds its track and keeps the cells after it aligned (in flow, an
empty `""` is dropped).

`columns`/`rows`/`cell`/`span` are valid only on a grid (`layout: grid` or
`|table|`) — `span` is also a chart band's extent ([`CHARTS.md`](CHARTS.md)); using
them elsewhere is an error.

### Dividers

`divider` draws separators between flow children, painted by the container's
`stroke` / `stroke-width` / `stroke-style`:

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `none` (default) | no separators |
| `all` | every **interior** separator — in 1-D between children; in a grid between rows and columns |
| `rows` / `columns` | grid only — separators along that axis |

Dividers are **interior only** — the outer frame is the container's own border (its
`stroke`), so a frameless grid (`stroke: none`) shows only inner lines and a
bordered one is never doubled. `divider` is span-aware in grids (a separator never
crosses a spanning cell's interior, and a shared edge is never drawn twice) and
skips pinned children.

A container with `divider` other than `none` **requires `gap: 0`** (an error
otherwise): a separator wants the cells flush against it. This is what lets
`|table|` be plain `grid + divider: all + gap: 0` rather than a magic type (see
[§8](#8-templates)).

### Container properties

| Property | Applies to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `layout` | all | `flow`, `grid` (chart / pie via templates). |
| `direction` | flow | `row` / `column` — orients a flow. Default `column`. (A chart's `direction` also takes `radial`.) |
| `gap` | all | Space between children. `N` = both axes; `row col` per axis. Must be `≥ 0`; `0` required with `divider`. |
| `padding` | all | Inner padding. `N`, `v h`, or `t r b l`. On a `\|table\|`, the inset around each cell's text. |
| `align` / `justify` | all | Cross / main axis (above). |
| `columns` / `rows` | grid | Track lists (above). |
| `divider` | all | Separators (above). |
| `fill` | all | Body colour; on the root it is the **canvas** colour. |
| `routing` | all | Routing strategy for links in this scope ([§9](#9-links)). |

## 6. Positioning & Anchors

A node's **bounding box** is the smallest axis-aligned rectangle containing it,
stroke included.

1. **Center origin.** Every bbox is centered at the parent's origin by default.
2. **Source order = render order;** later draws on top, with pinned children above
   the in-flow ones. `layer: N` overrides; ties break by source order.
3. **Strokes count** toward the bbox — `width: 100 height: 50 stroke-width: 4` →
   104×54.
4. **`|path|`** is the only center-origin exception — `path:` uses native top-left
   coordinates.
5. **Rotation** applies last as an SVG transform; the rotated bounding rectangle
   propagates upward.

### `pin` — out of the flow

Every child is **in flow** by default — laid out by its container's `layout`
([§5](#5-layout)). **`pin` lifts a child out**, aligning the child's **matching
point** flush with a named point of the parent:

| `pin:` | The child sits… |
|---|---|
| `none` *(default)* | — in flow; nothing is pinned |
| `center` | centre on the parent's centre |
| `top` · `bottom` · `left` · `right` | flush against that parent edge |
| `top left` · `top right` · `bottom left` · `bottom right` | with its corner on that parent corner |

The child's *own* matching point lands on the parent's, so it sits **flush**. The
anchor is the parent's **drawn box** — border and padding included. Corners fall out
of the value, so one switch covers every anchor: no compound knobs.

A pinned child is an **overlay**. It **does not grow the parent** — a parent of only
pinned children collapses to `2 × padding` — and it **paints above** the in-flow
children, so a badge needs no explicit `layer`. The canvas always includes it, so an
overlay is never clipped. Set `layer:` to reorder overlapping pins, or to push one
*beneath* the flow.

### `translate` — the universal nudge

**`translate: x y`** shifts a node by (x, y) *after* it is placed. It works on
**every** node — flow children, pinned children, text nodes, the root alike — and is
layout-neutral: siblings don't move, the parent doesn't grow, no size changes. It is
CSS's standalone `translate`, baked into the node's origin (so a standalone SVG needs
no transform variable); the canvas still includes the shifted node.

There is **no numeric coordinate property**. Because the parent's origin is its
center, `pin: center` + `translate: x y` lands a child's center at parent-local
(x, y) — explicit coordinates with no node-size arithmetic.

`translate` and `rotate` are the two positioning knobs that work on **any** node,
text included — so a link label or a stray string can be nudged or turned in place.
`pin` (which needs a parent anchor and takes a child out of the flow) is a **box**
job; to pin text, wrap it in a `|block|`.

### Auto-sizing

`width` and `height` default to **`auto`** — the bbox sizes to its content (text or
child nodes) **plus `padding` on each side** (default 20; there is no separate text
padding). Sizing is **border-box**: padding sits *inside* the box, never added on
top, and the two axes are independent. An explicit `width` / `height` is a **floor**
— the box is exactly that size when its content fits, and grows past it (to
`content + padding`) when the content is larger, so a box never clips or spills its
content. A box with no in-flow content — empty, or holding only `pin`ned overlays —
has nothing to grow for: an explicit size stands exactly as written, and an **auto**
one falls to **`2 × padding`** on each axis (the default `padding` 20 gives a 40 × 40
minimum).

**Padding also places the content.** The content area is the box inset by `padding`,
and the content sits within it; symmetric padding centres it, while an asymmetric
`padding: t r b l` offsets it — `padding: 4 4 20 4` lifts the content toward the top,
away from the larger bottom inset, exactly like CSS.

Exceptions: a **text** node sizes to its glyphs (no padding), widened by
`letter-spacing` and given `line-spacing` between `\n` lines; `|icon|` is a square
that grows with its `[ ]` text (a `32` floor) and needs a `symbol`; `|line|` / `|poly|` /
`|image|` / `|path|` require their geometry (`points` / `src` / `path`) and error
without it. `|block|` carries `padding: 0`, so a bare block sizes to its content
exactly.

Text width uses one advance per character (≈ 0.6 em). The default font is monospace,
so this is essentially exact; a proportional `font-family` override makes it
approximate until embedded font metrics land ([§20](#20-deferred)).

## 7. Nodes

11 primitives. All accept position and visual properties; closed primitives also
accept `stack`, `rotate`, `shadow`. Text is **not** a primitive — it is bare content
([§3](#3-statements)); the frameless `|block|` box ([§8](#8-templates)) is what you
reach for when text needs an id, a class, a link, or box layout.

**Dimensions** use `width` / `height`, each defaulting to `auto` (content + padding,
**border-box** — see [§6](#6-positioning--anchors)). They are always **bbox
dimensions**: `|oval| { width: 60; height: 40 }` is an ellipse in a 60×40 box; equal
dimensions (or an empty `|oval|`) make a circle.

| Primitive | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `\|block\|` | size (auto) | The base rectangle — frameless (no fill/stroke, `radius: 0`, `padding: 0`), like a `div`. `\|box\|` frames + rounds it, `\|rect\|` frames it sharp ([§8](#8-templates)). |
| `\|oval\|` | size (auto) | Bbox ellipse; equal width/height = circle. |
| `\|hex\|` | size (auto) | Regular hex, flat top/bottom. |
| `\|slant\|` | size (auto) | Parallelogram; top edge shifted `tan(skew) × h`. `skew` in degrees, (-89, 89). |
| `\|cyl\|` | size (auto) | Cylinder; end ellipses ≈ h/10. |
| `\|diamond\|` | size (auto) | Rhombus inscribed in the bbox. |
| `\|poly\|` | `points` | ≥3 points, local (center-origin) coords. Closed. |
| `\|path\|` | `path` | Raw SVG path. **Native top-left coords.** |
| `\|line\|` | `points` | 2+ points. Markers via `marker*:`. |
| `\|icon\|` | `symbol` | A **Phosphor** icon — `symbol:` (or the label) names it; paints two-tone like a box (`fill` body, `stroke` line, counter-scaled `stroke-width`). A square that grows with its `[ ]` text (`32` floor); `\|sign\|` is the larger preset. See [Icons](#icons). |
| `\|image\|` | `src`, `width`, `height` | `<image href="…">`. External URLs only; both dimensions required. `fit` maps it into the box — `auto` (default, letterbox), `contain`, `cover`, or `stretch`. |

### Visual modifiers (closed primitives)

| Property | Forms | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `stroke-style` | `solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` | Stroke pattern. Default `solid`. (`wavy` draws on links — [§9](#9-links); on closed primitives it is deferred — [§20](#20-deferred).) |
| `stack` | `N` / `dx dy` | Draw an offset duplicate behind the node. Scalar `N` = `N -N`. |
| `rotate` | `N` degrees | Rotate around the bbox center. |
| `shadow` | `N` / `dx dy` / `dx dy blur` / `dx dy blur color` | Drop shadow via SVG `<filter>`. Scalar `N` = offset `N N`, blur `N`; tint defaults to `--lini-shadow-color`. |

### Markers (on `|line|` and links)

| Property | Effect |
|---|---|
| `marker: X` | Both ends. |
| `marker-start: X` | Start end (link source). |
| `marker-end: X` | End end (link target). |

Values: `none`, `arrow`, `dot`, `circle`, `diamond`, `crow`. `circle` is a larger `dot` —
a filled point sized for hovering or reading (on a chart line it marks a data point;
[CHARTS §3](CHARTS.md)). Markers scale with `stroke-width` (on a link, with `link-width`),
floor 5 px; colour follows the stroke / link colour.
`|line|` is bare by default — write `|line| { marker-end: arrow }` for a one-shot
arrow. For links the operator picks markers (see [§9](#9-links)). Source order wins:
`marker: arrow; marker-end: dot` → start arrow, end dot.

### Icons

`|icon|` draws a **[Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/)** icon (MIT) as inline SVG
paths — themeable, reproducible, and renderer-agnostic (no icon font). The `symbol`
property names it — or, as the [smart label](#the-label), the string does (`|icon| "heart"` is
`|icon| { symbol: heart }`); everything else paints like a box:

```
|icon| "bell"                                          // symbol via the label
|icon| { symbol: warning-circle; stroke: --amber-ink } // the longhand
|icon| "heart" { fill: --rose-wash; stroke: --rose-ink }
|icon#tag| "bell" [ "3" ]                              // symbol bell, "3" rides as text
```

Setting the symbol twice — a label *and* `{ symbol: … }` — is an error; pick one. A
text label on an icon rides in the `[ ]` (`|icon| "bell" [ "3" ]`).

Phosphor icons are **two-tone** (a soft fill behind a line), so an icon wears Lini's
paint roles like any node: **`fill`** paints the body, **`stroke`** the line,
**`stroke-width`** its weight. The defaults make the duotone read out of the box —
`fill` a soft grey (`--icon-fill`), `stroke` the ink (`--stroke`, matching borders
and wires), `stroke-width` 2. A single-tone line icon is `fill: none`; a hued duotone
is `fill: --teal-wash; stroke: --teal-ink`, exactly like a card.

`stroke-width` is **counter-scaled**: an icon is authored on a 256-unit grid and fit
to its box, and the stroke is divided by that scale (baked at compile time), so its
line weight holds as the icon resizes and matches the diagram's other strokes.

An icon is a **square** that grows uniformly with its `[ ]` text (and `padding`): the
side is a `32` floor (`icon-size`) over the text + padding on either axis, so an
empty icon is 32×32 and a longer label scales the **whole icon up** — symbol and all
— keeping its proportion (the symbol never distorts). For a larger stand-alone icon,
reach for `|sign|` ([§8](#8-templates)).

**`fit`** controls how the symbol fills that box. By default (`fit: auto`) an icon
keeps Phosphor's authored framing — each glyph sits in the 256-grid with its own
built-in margin, so different glyphs fill the box by different amounts and a row of
mixed icons reads at an even weight. `fit: contain` scales the glyph's *own* bounds
up until they meet the box (filling it — and `|sign|` defaults to it); `cover` scales
until the box is covered (the glyph may overflow); `stretch` fits both axes (may
distort). The counter-scaled `stroke-width` follows the resulting scale, so the line
weight stays constant whichever `fit` you choose ([§11](#11-properties)).

A missing `symbol` errors like `|poly|` without `points`; an unknown one suggests the
nearest name. Only the icons a diagram uses are embedded (a default-on `icons` feature,
[§20](#20-deferred)).

---

## 8. Templates

Built-in types — each a bundle over a primitive base, named because the pattern is
common. **Every rectangular template is a bundle over `|block|`**; the non-rect
primitives ([§7](#7-nodes)) stand on their own.

| Template | Base | Defaults | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `\|box\|` | `\|block\|` | `fill: --fill; stroke: --stroke; stroke-width: 1.5; radius: 6; padding: 20` | The **default** node — a rounded, framed card. |
| `\|rect\|` | `\|box\|` | `radius: 0` | A sharp-cornered box. |
| `\|group\|` | `\|block\|` | `stroke: --group-stroke; stroke-style: dashed; stroke-width: 1; fill: --group-fill; radius: 6; padding: 20` | Dashed frame for a caption + children. |
| `\|caption\|` | `\|block\|` | `pin: top left; translate: 0 -18; color: --caption-color; font-size: 12; font-weight: normal` | A title, pinned just above the group's top-left corner. |
| `\|footer\|` | `\|caption\|` | `pin: bottom; translate: 0 17; font-size: 11; color: --footer-color` | A caption flipped to the bottom edge, centred and muted. |
| `\|badge\|` | `\|block\|` | `pin: top right; translate: 6 -6; radius: 8; padding: 2 6; shadow: 2 3 3; fill: --accent; color: --accent-text; font-size: 11; font-weight: normal` | Corner pill — nudged out over the top-right corner, grows nothing. |
| `\|row\|` | `\|block\|` | `direction: row` | Frameless wrapper — children in a row. |
| `\|column\|` | `\|block\|` | `direction: column` | Frameless wrapper — children in a column. |
| `\|grid\|` | `\|block\|` | `layout: grid` | Frameless grid (needs `columns`). |
| `\|sign\|` | `\|icon\|` | `width: 64; height: 64; padding: 4; stroke-width: 1.5; fit: contain` | A larger icon as a stand-alone node, with room for a short label; `fit: contain` fills the box (unlike a bare `\|icon\|`), and its line weight drops to the node default `1.5` (a bare `\|icon\|` keeps `2`). |
| `\|table\|` | `\|group\|` | `layout: grid; divider: all; gap: 0; padding: 4 8; fill: none; stroke: --stroke; stroke-style: solid; font-size: 14; font-weight: normal` | Ruled grid (see below). |

The bare `|block|` is the base everything rectangular builds on: no fill, no stroke,
`radius: 0`, `padding: 0` — a frameless box that shows only its content, but is a real
box (id, class, children, wirable, positionable). It is what you reach for to wrap
text that needs box behaviour.

**Captions.** A `|caption|` is a small `|block|` **pinned** just above the group's
top-left corner; a `|footer|` is the same flipped to the bottom. Both are out-of-flow
overlays, so they never push the content, and their place is fixed by the template,
not by where they sit among the children. A group's **label is its caption** ([§3](#the-label)),
so the two forms are equal:

```
|group#panel| "Settings" [          // label → caption
  |box#a| "General"
  |box#b| "Network"
  |footer| "synced"
]
|group#panel| [                     // the explicit form
  |caption| "Settings"
  …
]
```

Style every caption globally with `|caption| { font-size: 16; font-weight: bold }` —
that targets captions without touching body text. Because a caption is pinned (not in
flow), a group laid out as a `row` carries its title just the same.

**Tables.** A `|table|` is sugar — a `group` that is a grid, draws dividers, and has
`gap: 0`. Cells are **bare text** that auto-flows into the tracks; there is no
`|cell|` type and no per-cell styling beyond the text's own style block — spacing
comes from the track sizes (`columns` / `rows`) and the table's `padding`. The outer
frame is the group border and the inner lines are `divider: all`, both painted by the
table's `stroke*`; no edge is ever doubled. A table's label is its caption.

```
|table#basket| {
  columns: 80 140 80;
} [
  "Fruit" "Quantity" "Notes"
  "Apple" "12"       "fresh"
  "Mango" "3"        "ripe"
]
```

`fmt` knows the column count and pads the cells into aligned columns, so the flat form
reads like the table it is. A cell that must be placed or linked is a **box** child
(`|block| "X"` or `|box| { cell: 2 1; … }`); a cell that just needs a colour or
weight can take its own style block (`"Apple" { color: --red-ink }`).

Extend any template: `|panel::group| { stroke: --accent }`. Common nodes need no
template:

| For | Write |
|---|---|
| Circle | `\|oval\| { width: 40 }` |
| Database | `\|cyl\|` |
| Arrow | `\|line\| { marker-end: arrow; points: 0 0, 50 0 }` |

---

## 9. Links

A link connects scene-node ids with an operator (`a -> b`). Like every node it has a
`{ }` **style** and a `[ ]` of **content** — its content is its **labels** (text),
placed along the route by `along:`. It is never written as a `|link|` instance; the
operator draws it.

Defaults for every link — `link` (colour), `link-width`, `link-style`, `clearance`,
`marker*`, `routing` — **cascade** from the link's scope: set them on the root or any
container's `{ }` and they reach every link in that scope, exactly as `color` reaches
text. A link's own `{ }` overrides.

### Operators

A link op is `[start_marker?][line][end_marker?]`, no spaces:

| Part | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Line | `-` solid · `--` dashed · `---` dotted · `~` wavy |
| Start markers | `<` arrow · `>` crow · `*` dot · `<>` diamond |
| End markers | `>` arrow · `<` crow · `*` dot · `<>` diamond |

The line grows more broken as it lengthens — solid `-`, dashed `--`, dotted `---`.
The same marker glyph differs by position (`<` is arrow at the start, crow at the
end).

| Op | Markers / Line |
|---|---|
| `->` `<-` `<->` | arrow combinations, solid |
| `-*` `*-` `*-*` | dot combinations |
| `-<>` `<>-<>` | diamond |
| `-<` `>-<` | crow |
| `-->` `--->` `~>` | dashed / dotted / wavy |
| `-` `--` `---` `~` | no markers (each line style) |

If the operator carries no markers, there are none on both ends. Explicit `marker:` /
`marker-start:` / `marker-end:` override the operator (source order wins). The
operator's line part sets the link's `link-style` (`--` ⇒ `dashed`, `---` ⇒ `dotted`,
`~` ⇒ `wavy`); an explicit `link-style:` overrides it.

### Syntax

```
endpoints op endpoints [op endpoints …] [ "label" ] [ .class… ] [ { style } ] [ [ labels ] ]
```

The tail is the **node tail** (`"label" .class { style } [ … ]`); only the head differs
— endpoints + operators, versus bars — and a link's `[ ]` holds only labels (text),
where a node's holds children.

`endpoints` is one or more endpoints joined by `&`:

```
a -> b               // 1 link
a -> b -> c          // chain: 2 links
a -> b & c           // fan-out: a→b, a→c
a & b -> c           // fan-in
a & b -> c & d       // cartesian: 4 links
a -> b -> c & d      // chain + fan
```

Mixing operators in one chain is a parse error.

A link's **class follows** its endpoints (`a -> b .loud`), exactly as a node's
follows its identity (`|box| .loud`) — one `.class` slot, after the head, on both; a
class never lives in the bars. On a chain or fan, the label, class, and `{ }` apply to
every link the statement expands to.

### Styling

`link` / `link-width` / `link-style` are the **link paint family**, parallel to
`stroke` / `stroke-width` / `stroke-style` for nodes and `color` for text:

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `link` | colour | `--stroke` | The line colour. |
| `link-width` | number | 2 | Line thickness; markers scale with it. |
| `link-style` | `solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` / `wavy` | from the operator | The dash pattern; usually set by the op (`-->` ⇒ dashed), overridable here. |

A link is a **link, not a stroked shape**: it is painted by this family alone, so
`stroke` / `stroke-width` / `stroke-style` on a link — in its own `{ }` or a class it
wears — is an **error** that names the `link*` replacement. A class meant for links
uses `link*` (`.flow { link: --blue }`), one meant for nodes uses `stroke*`.

All three cascade from the link's scope and override on the link's own `{ }`:

```
{ link: #888; link-width: 1.5; clearance: 12; routing: orthogonal }
a -> b { link: red; link-style: dashed }     // one link overrides
```

`clearance` (default 16) and `routing` (default `orthogonal`) cascade the same way;
`marker*` come from the operator and override per link.

### Labels

A link's label is **text**, placed along the route by `along:` — the link's track
rule, exactly as `columns:` is a grid's. One label trails the head (`a -> b
"watches"`); two or more, or a styled one, ride the `[ ]`:

| Property | Notes |
|---|---|
| `along` | A list of `0..1` fractions along the whole drawn route, one per label (`along: 0.2 0.5 0.8`). Omitted → auto-distribute across the hops, so one label avoids junctions and several spread out. |

`along:` and any link style live in the `{ }`; the labels are the head string and the
content:

```
a -> b "watches"                                // the common case — one label, auto-placed
a -> b "watches" .loud { link: red }            // + a class and link style
a -> b { along: 0.3 0.7 } [ "near a" "near b" ] // two labels
a -> b [ "watches" { translate: 0 -6 } ]        // a styled / nudged label
```

Each label is an ordinary **styleable text leaf** ([§3](#3-statements)): give it its
own `{ }` in the `[ ]` to nudge or turn it. The head label takes no style — the `{ }`
after a link's head is the *link's* — so a styled label rides the `[ ]`, exactly as a
node's does. A label is an obstacle to nothing, and may slide along the link to keep
clear of nodes and other labels; the link never moves for it. Link labels default to
`font-size: 11`, `font-weight: normal`, and are tinted by the link's `color` — each
link carries those baked text defaults, cascading to its labels; set `font-size` /
`color` on the link to restyle them all at once, or on a label to restyle one.

### Endpoints & scope

```
endpoint = ident { "." ident } [ ":" side ]
side     = top | bottom | left | right
```

A path walks with `.` into children; a final `:side` forces a side. Every link
resolves in a **scope** — the scene root for top-level links, the container's body for
links written inside one. The first segment names a node in the scope, each further
segment a child of the previous. **There is no search.** A single bare id not in the
scope auto-creates a box there ([Implicit nodes](#implicit-nodes)); a **multi-segment
path** that does not resolve is an error, and the error suggests full paths of
same-named nodes —
`link endpoint 'kitchen.bowl' not found at scene root; did you mean 'kitchen.counter.bowl'?`

| Endpoint (root link) | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `cat` | root node `cat` |
| `kitchen.counter.bowl` | exactly that path |
| `kitchen.counter.bowl:left` | the same node, left side forced |

Bodies are **sealed**: a body link connects nodes of its own subtree only.
Cross-container links are written at the lowest level where both ends are visible —
usually the root. Without a side the router picks edges by geometry; with a `:side`,
that edge is forced.

### Internal links in a body

A container's (or define's) `[ ]` may link its own children — children and links read in
**source order**, so a wire usually trails the boxes it joins but may also sit among them
(a `layout: sequence` ([§10](#10-sequences)) relies on this — its frames interleave with its
messages). In a define, ids are local and materialize per instance — the same sealed-body
rule. From outside, the dot-path navigates in:

```
{
  |room::group| {
    gap: 10;
  } [
    |box#inlet|  "Inlet"
    |box#outlet| "Outlet"
    inlet -> outlet "flows"
  ]
}

|room#garden|  "Garden"
|room#kitchen| "Kitchen"
garden.outlet -> kitchen.inlet "carries"
```

### Routing

Links route **orthogonally** by default — horizontal and vertical runs through the
free space between nodes, corners rounded. The router picks entry/exit sides unless an
explicit `:side` forces one. `clearance` (default 16) is the minimum gap every link
keeps from nodes and from other links.

`routing` selects the strategy for a scope and cascades like `clearance`: `orthogonal`
(the default and the only mode built today) routes by the contract below; `straight`
and `curved` are named but deferred ([§20](#20-deferred)). It pairs with `layout` —
`layout` places the nodes, `routing` routes the links between them — so a group can
route its internals one way while the root routes another.

The full routing contract — clearance, spacing, crossings, fan-out, self-loops — lives
in [`LINKING.md`](LINKING.md), the source of truth for routing.

---

## 10. Sequences

A **sequence** reads a diagram on a **time axis**: `layout: sequence` places named
**participants** across the top, drops a **lifeline** from each, and lays **messages** —
ordinary links — top-to-bottom **in source order**, so the order you write the wires *is*
the order they happen. Like a chart ([CHARTS.md](CHARTS.md)) it is a layout that **lowers
to primitives** — participants, lifelines, arrows, frames, and notes all become `|block|`s,
`|line|`s, and text — so the cascade, palette, theming, and baking apply unchanged. It adds
**no grammar**: participants are nodes, messages are links ([§9](#9-links)), frames and notes
are nodes — only the engine and a handful of type names are new.

A sequence is **the one place a link's *order* is its geometry**, not a routing problem: the
orthogonal router ([LINKING.md](LINKING.md)) is replaced in this scope by a sequence
**wiring strategy** that draws each message as a horizontal arrow at its time row. (One
isolated subsystem, one strategy per scope: `orthogonal` for `flow` / `grid`, the
named-but-deferred `straight` / `curved` for future graph layouts — [§20](#20-deferred) —
and `sequence` here, picked by the layout rather than `routing:`.)

### The sequence container

`layout: sequence` on the root (`{ layout: sequence }`) or any node makes a sequence; the
`|sequence|` template is the preset over `|block|`, exactly as `|chart|` is `layout: chart`.
Its children **split by role, recognised by type** the chart way ([CHARTS.md](CHARTS.md) §3) —
`|loop|` / `|opt|` / `|alt|` are frames, `|note|` a note, and every **other** box a
participant:

| Child | Is a | Drawn |
|---|---|---|
| a box (`\|box\|`, `\|cyl\|`, `\|icon\|`, …) | participant | a header at the top + a lifeline down |
| a link (`a -> b`) | message | a time-row arrow between two lifelines |
| `\|loop\|` / `\|opt\|` / `\|alt\|` | frame | a labelled rectangle around a span of messages |
| `\|note\|` | note | a callout over / beside lifelines |

**In a sequence scope, nodes and links interleave in source order** — the "children before
links" rule ([§3](#3-statements)) relaxes to *source order preserved*, because a frame (a
node) must sit among the messages (links) around it. Elsewhere the order of unrelated nodes
and links is invisible, so nothing else changes.

`gap` is the one spacing knob: its **row** part is the time pitch between messages, its
**column** part the space between participants (`gap: row col`, [§5](#5-layout)).
`width` / `height` size the whole frame; unset, it sizes to its content.

### Participants & lifelines

A participant is an ordinary node; its **smart label** is its header text ([§3](#the-label)).
Participants sit across the top **in declaration order** (left to right), each dropping a
**lifeline** — a thin vertical line in the scene's `stroke`, run to the last message that
touches it. An **undeclared** endpoint **auto-creates** a participant ([§3](#implicit-nodes)) —
`a -> b` with neither declared draws two — appended in first-use order, so a quick sequence
needs no header:

```
{ layout: sequence }
user   -> server "login"     // two auto-created participants, one message
server --> user  "token"
```

Declare a participant to fix its order, type, or paint (`|cyl#db| "Store"`); any box works,
so an actor is just `|icon| "user"`. A participant carries its own `{ }` and classes like any
node.

### Messages

A message is a **link** ([§9](#9-links)) read on the time axis: its operator picks the look,
its label rides above the arrow, its order is its row.

| Write | Means |
|---|---|
| `a -> b "x"` | a **call** — solid arrow, `a` to `b` |
| `a --> b "x"` | a **return** — dashed arrow |
| `a ~> b "x"` | an **async** message — wavy arrow |
| `a -> a "x"` | a **self-message** — a hook on `a`'s own lifeline, label to the right |

Every operator, marker, class, and `{ }` is the link's own ([§9](#9-links)); only the
*placement* differs, so a message's label sits centred above its arrow and `along:`
([§9](#labels)) has no role. A chain `a -> b -> c` is two messages on two rows; a fan
`a -> b & c` likewise expands to two, in expansion order. A forced side (`a:left`) and
`routing` have no meaning on a time-row arrow and are ignored.

### Activations

A participant is **active** while it handles a call. By default (`activation: auto`) a call
(`->`) **opens** an activation bar on its target's lifeline and the next **return** (`-->`)
from that target **closes** the most recent open one; nested calls **stack** (each bar offset
outward), and an unclosed bar runs to that participant's last message. An async `~>` opens
none. `activation: none` on the sequence draws no bars. (Explicit per-message control is
deferred — [§20](#20-deferred).)

### Frames

A frame is a **node whose `[ ]` holds its messages**, drawn as a labelled rectangle spanning
the lifelines those messages touch over the rows they occupy; its **smart label** is the
title in a top-left tab. Frames **nest** and read in source order like everything else:

| Frame | Means |
|---|---|
| `\|loop\| "guard"` | the messages **repeat** (drawn once, not unrolled) |
| `\|opt\| "guard"` | the messages happen **only if** the guard holds (an *if*) |
| `\|alt\| "guard"` | one of several **alternatives** (an *if/else*) |

An `|alt|` holds two or more **compartments** split by `|else| "guard"` — a divider node
valid only inside an `|alt|`, its label that branch's guard; the first compartment's guard is
the `|alt|`'s own label:

```
api -> db "query"
|alt| "found" [
  db --> api "row"
  |else| "missing"
  db --> api "404"
]
api --> user "done"
```

`par` (parallel) and other fragments are deferred ([§20](#20-deferred)).

### Notes

A `|note|` is a callout placed at its time row (source order), bound to lifelines by
**placement**:

| Write | Draws |
|---|---|
| `\|note\| "text" { over: api }` | a box **over** one lifeline |
| `\|note\| "text" { over: api db }` | a box spanning those lifelines (and any between) |
| `\|note\| "text" { left: api }` · `{ right: api }` | a box beside a lifeline |

Its smart label is the text; a multi-line or styled note rides the `[ ]` like any box
([§3](#text-content)). `over` / `left` / `right` are valid only in a sequence.

### Lowering

`layout: sequence` resolves in the **layout** phase ([§18](#18-implementer-algorithm)), since
a message's x-ends are the lifelines' positions (fixed only once participants are placed) and
its y is its row:

1. **Place** participants across the top in declaration order; fix each lifeline's x.
2. **Walk** the scope's messages, frames, and notes in **source order**, giving each message a
   **row** — a frame records the row span of its contents, a note its row.
3. **Lower** every part to primitives at baked coordinates: header → `|block|` + text,
   lifeline / arrow → `|line|`, activation / frame / note → `|block|`, label → text. Messages
   are placed by the sequence wiring strategy, the orthogonal router bypassed in this scope.

The output is an ordinary primitive subtree — so render, theming, palette, `--bake-vars`,
`fmt`, and determinism ([§14](#14-svg-output), [§18](#18-implementer-algorithm)) all apply
with no sequence-specific code, exactly as for a chart ([CHARTS.md](CHARTS.md) §15).

## 11. Properties

Every property is `name: value;`. Dash-case names; positional, space-separated values.

### Paint

| Property | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `fill` | color | `--fill` (closed primitives); `currentColor` on text; `--icon-fill` (a soft grey) for icons; `--bg` on the root (the scene background) |
| `color` | color | inherits — sets text colour for descendants; on text, an alias for `fill` |
| `opacity` | 0..1 | 1 |
| `radius` | number | 0 (`\|block\|`); `\|box\|` rounds to 6 |
| `rotate` | degrees | 0 |
| `skew` | degrees | 15 (`\|slant\|` only) |
| `shadow` | `N` / `dx dy` / `dx dy blur` / `dx dy blur color` | off |
| `stack` | `N` / `dx dy` | off (closed primitives only) |

`color` cascades through the SVG via native `currentColor`: set it on a container to
recolour every descendant's text that doesn't override. Use `color` for *labels*,
`fill` for *bodies*. `fill`, `stroke`, and `link` all accept a **gradient** as well as
a flat colour ([§12.3](#123-gradients)).

### Stroke

| Property | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `stroke` | color | `--stroke` (a node's outline / a `\|line\|`'s colour) |
| `stroke-width` | number | 2 (`\|group\|` is `1`) |
| `stroke-style` | `solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` | `solid` |

`stroke*` paints a **shape's** outline; a **link** uses the parallel `link*` family
below (`stroke*` on a link is an error — [§9](#9-links)).

### Links

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `link` | color | `--stroke` | A link's line colour ([§9](#9-links)). Cascades to links in scope. |
| `link-width` | number | 2 | A link's thickness. |
| `link-style` | `solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` / `wavy` | from the operator | A link's dash pattern. |
| `clearance` | number | 16 | Min gap a link keeps from nodes and links. Cascades. |
| `routing` | `orthogonal` (+ deferred) | `orthogonal` | Routing strategy for links in scope. Cascades. |
| `along` | fraction list | auto | Label positions along the route. |
| `marker` / `marker-start` / `marker-end` | marker | from the operator | Endpoint glyphs ([§7](#7-nodes)). |

`link*`, `clearance`, and `routing` are **inheritable**: set on the root or a
container, they reach every link in that scope; a link's own block overrides.

### Geometry & placement

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `width`, `height` | number / `auto` | bbox dims, **border-box** (padding inside); a **floor** — at least this size, growing to `content + padding` when content is larger. Default `auto` = content + padding. `\|image\|` needs both. |
| `pin` | `none` / `center` / edges / corners | Out-of-flow anchor — the child's matching point lands on the named parent point ([§6](#6-positioning--anchors)). A **box** property. |
| `translate` | `x y` | Post-placement nudge of the node and its subtree; no reflow, grows nothing ([§6](#6-positioning--anchors)). Works on **any** node, text included. |
| `layer` | integer | Paint order; default 0 in flow, 1 when `pin`ned. Ties break on source order. |
| `points` | `x y, x y, …` / expr | Vertex list (`\|poly\|`, `\|line\|`), or a parametric expression in `u` sampled at `samples` ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)). |
| `samples` | integer | Sample count when `points` is a parametric expression. |
| `path` | string | Raw SVG path (`\|path\|`, native top-left coords). |
| `symbol` | ident | Icon name (`\|icon\|`) — a Phosphor symbol, e.g. `heart`, `warning-circle`. The smart label sets it too (`\|icon\| "heart"`). |
| `fit` | `auto` / `contain` / `cover` / `stretch` | How an `\|icon\|` symbol or `\|image\|` maps into its box — the box size is unchanged. `auto` (default) keeps the natural framing (Phosphor's 256-grid margin for an icon, letterbox for an image); `contain` scales the content uniformly to fit inside, `cover` to cover the box (may overflow / crop), `stretch` fills both axes (may distort). For an icon, `contain`/`cover`/`stretch` measure the glyph's own bounds; [Icons](#icons). |

`pin`, `width`/`height`, `points`, and `path` are **box** properties — a bare text
node carries none of them; `translate` and `rotate` are the exceptions and work on
text too. To pin or size a piece of text, wrap it in a `|block|`.

### Spacing & layout

`padding`, `gap`, `layout`, `align`, `justify`, `columns`, `rows`, `cell`, `span`,
`divider`, `routing` — see [Layout](#5-layout) and
[Positioning](#6-positioning--anchors). Longhands
`padding-top`/`-right`/`-bottom`/`-left` are accepted.

### Text

| Property | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `font-family` | `--font-family` | ident, string, or `--var`. |
| `font-size` | 15 (body), 12 (caption), 11 (link label) | px; a baked layout constant. |
| `font-weight` | `--font-weight` (body `normal`; chart title / legend `bold`) | `normal` / `bold`. |
| `font-style` | `normal` | `normal` / `italic` / `oblique` — live CSS. |
| `text-transform` | `none` | `uppercase` / `lowercase` / `capitalize` — live CSS (browser-applied; some SVG renderers ignore it). |
| `text-decoration` | `none` | `underline` / `overline` / `line-through` — live CSS. |
| `letter-spacing` | 0 | px between characters — positive widens, negative tightens. |
| `line-spacing` | 0 | px added between the lines of a `\n` text block. |

These all **inherit** — nearest ancestor wins, like CSS. Set them on a containing box
(or the root) and they cascade down, or set them directly on a string's own style
block (`"x" { font-weight: bold }`) for that one text node. Style globally with
`font-size: …` in the stylesheet, or scope it on a container. A global `font-family:` /
`color:` works too, but for an **embeddable** diagram prefer the `--lini-font-family` /
`--lini-text-color` variables (or `--theme`) — they stay live for a host page to
re-theme, where a global property bakes its value into the `.lini` rule.

`letter-spacing` and `line-spacing` are **baked spacing**, not CSS: they change
**layout** — the text box grows to fit the wider glyphs or taller block — and the
spacing compiles into the glyph and line positions (like `padding`), never emitted as a
style. Both default to 0, so text is unaffected until set.

`font-style`, `text-transform`, and `text-decoration` are the reverse — **live CSS**
with no baked default: they don't touch layout, ride the class / `<g>` / `.lini` rule,
and a host page can override them. Set any in the global block to style the whole scene
(it states on `.lini`), exactly like a global `font-size:`.

### Media & accessibility

| Property | Notes |
|---|---|
| `src` | image source (`\|image\|`) — a quoted URL. |
| `href` | wraps this node or link in `<a href>` — a quoted URL; clickable. |
| `title` | quoted text — emits a `<title>` child (tooltip + screen-reader name). |

### Variables & expressions

`--name: value;` declares a themeable **visual** variable (a colour or font),
referenced as `--name` and staying live `var()`. Layout values bake — a literal, a
backtick expression, or a function call ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)). See
[Colour, Variables & Defaults](#12-colour-variables--defaults).

---

## 12. Colour, Variables & Defaults

CSS variables theme the **visual** layer — colours and the font family. Everything
that affects layout — sizes, gaps, padding, and font *size* — is a baked constant, so
a standalone SVG never depends on host CSS.

### 12.1 Visual variables (live, themeable)

Each colour is a `light-dark(LIGHT, DARK)` value, so one SVG carries both modes:

```
--lini-bg            light-dark(white, #1b1b1f)      the scene background
--lini-fg            light-dark(black, #e8e8ea)
--lini-fill          light-dark(white, #26262b)
--lini-stroke        light-dark(#444, #9aa0a6)
--lini-accent        light-dark(#0a84ff, #4aa3ff)
--lini-accent-text   white                           text on an accent fill (e.g. a badge)
--lini-muted         light-dark(#888, #9aa0a6)
--lini-danger        light-dark(crimson, #ff6b6b)
--lini-warn          light-dark(orange, #ffb454)
--lini-stray         light-dark(crimson, #ff6b6b)    the stray-link fallback (LINKING.md, §Impossible layouts)
--lini-group-stroke  light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.4), rgba(255,255,255,.4))
--lini-group-fill    light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.03), rgba(255,255,255,.05))
--lini-icon-fill     light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.16), rgba(255,255,255,.18))  the soft body behind a duotone icon
--lini-caption-color light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.5), rgba(255,255,255,.55))
--lini-footer-color  light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.5), rgba(255,255,255,.55))
--lini-font-family   ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "Cascadia Code", "JetBrains Mono", Menlo, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", monospace
--lini-font-weight         normal
--lini-caption-font-weight normal
--lini-link-font-weight    normal
--lini-text-color    var(--lini-fg)
--lini-shadow-color  light-dark(rgba(0,0,0,.2), rgba(0,0,0,.5))
```

`--lini-bg` paints the scene background (the canvas rect), so the diagram is
self-contained in either mode. The default font is a **monospace** stack: it reads
crisp, and a fixed glyph advance keeps text-width estimation accurate without embedded
font metrics ([§20](#20-deferred)). Body text is **bold**, captions and link labels
**normal**. A themed proportional `font-family` is allowed but makes text width
approximate until embedded metrics land.

**Dark/light is automatic.** The compiler emits `color-scheme: light dark` on `.lini`,
so `light-dark()` follows the viewer's OS (`prefers-color-scheme`) — no script, no
`@media`. A `data-theme="dark"` / `"light"` on the SVG or any ancestor forces a mode
(it flips `color-scheme`, and its higher specificity beats the OS). All defaults sit in
`@layer lini.defaults`, so unlayered host CSS still wins with no `!important`.
`--bake-vars` freezes the light arm into literals for renderers without `light-dark()`
([§12.6](#126---bake-vars)).

### 12.2 The colour palette

Beyond the role variables, Lini ships a **named-hue palette** — pretty by default,
themeable, and dark/light-aware like everything else. Eleven hues, each a
`light-dark()` pair:

```
red  rose  orange  amber  lime  green  teal  sky  blue  purple  gray
```

Every hue carries **five tiers**, named for the job they do — not their lightness,
which would invert in dark mode:

| Tier | Example | Job |
|---|---|---|
| wash | `--teal-wash` | palest — card and section backgrounds (a faint tint; a deep, muted surface in dark mode) |
| soft | `--teal-soft` | a gentle, lighter pastel fill |
| base | `--teal` | the everyday pastel — **the bare name is the easy path** |
| deep | `--teal-deep` | the strong tone — borders and strokes |
| ink | `--teal-ink` | deepest and most saturated — text and emphasis (the high-contrast tone in dark mode) |

`fill: --teal` lands a friendly pastel; the job-names hold across the dark flip, so
`--teal-wash` is always the faint surface and `--teal-ink` always the high-contrast
detail — a promise a `light` / `dark` or numeric name could not keep.

```
{ |card::box| { fill: --teal-wash; stroke: --teal-ink } }   // a pretty card, one line
|box#n| { fill: --amber-soft }
```

The tiers are generated from one **OKLCH** seed per hue, so the ramp is perceptually
even and the eleven read as a family. The same space is open to you — `fill: oklch(0.7,
0.14, 200)` picks any colour directly ([§2](#2-lexical-syntax)). Names are conventional
— every one is an ordinary colour word, so `--blue`, `--red`, `--green` are all there —
with aliases for muscle memory: `--yellow → --amber`, `--pink → --rose`, `--indigo →
--purple`, `--cyan → --teal`. `red` stays clear for **danger**; `rose` is the warm pink
you decorate with (its `wash` / `soft` tiers are your pinks), `green` is tuned to an
emerald, and `lime` is the lemony one.

The palette is **tree-shaken** ([§14](#14-svg-output)): only the `--lini-*` variables a
diagram references are emitted, so the full palette costs a three-box diagram nothing.

### 12.3 Gradients

`fill`, `stroke`, and `link` accept a **gradient** in place of a flat colour. Stops are
ordinary colours — palette `--name`s flip dark/light and bake, a raw `#hex` is a fixed
literal.

| Form | Result |
|---|---|
| `gradient(--rose, --sky)` | two stops, auto-angled 135° — any two hues blend cleanly |
| `gradient(--rose, --amber, --sky)` | three or more evenly-spaced stops |
| `linear-gradient(135, --rose, --sky)` | an explicit angle in degrees — the control gate |
| `radial-gradient(--rose, --sky)` | a radial blend from the centre out |

```
|box#hero| { fill: gradient(--blue, --purple) }       // a single-family sheen
|badge#tag| { fill: gradient(--rose, --amber, --sky) } // a three-colour pop
```

The angle is the only "more syntax": `gradient(…)` is angle-less and always lands on a
flattering 135°, so the easy form can't look wrong. OKLCH stops keep the midpoint clean
rather than muddy.

Each distinct gradient is emitted once as a `<linearGradient>` / `<radialGradient>` in
`<defs>` and referenced by `url(#…)` — deduplicated and shared like the drop-shadow
`<filter>`s ([§14](#14-svg-output)). `objectBoundingBox` units fit one definition to
any node at any size. The stops being palette vars, a gradient themes, flips, and bakes
like any other paint; gradient-on-text is deferred ([§20](#20-deferred)).

### 12.4 `--name` references

`--name` is the **visual-variable namespace, and only that.** `--name: value;`
declares one (a built-in `--lini-*` name keeps its meaning; a new name is yours), and
`--name` in a value references it, emitting live `var(--lini-name)`:

```
{
  --brand: #ff6600;
}
|box#cat| { fill: --brand }
```

Alias a host var from CSS: `.lini { --lini-accent: var(--my-brand-blue); }`.

Layout values — sizes, gaps, padding, `font-size`, `clearance` — are **not** `--name`
variables: they bake (a runtime `var()` can't be measured at compile time). Set them
with a literal, a rule (`gap: 30;`, `|box| { radius: 4 }`), or a backtick expression /
function ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)).

### 12.5 Layout constants (baked)

Baked compile-time defaults — override per-node, on the root, in rules, or in an
instance / link block:

```
font-size 15     link-font-size 11   caption-font-size 12
stroke-width 1.5 radius 6            gap 20                 padding 20
clearance 16     icon-size 32        link-width 2          icon stroke-width 2
```

`font-size` is body text. Link labels and captions carry their own baked defaults (11
and 12); a global `font-size:` in the stylesheet sets body text and cascades, each link
carries the `link-font-size` default for its labels (set `font-size:` on a link to
change them), and `|caption| { font-size: … }` sets captions. `radius` rounds a `|box|`
by default; `|block|` / `|rect|` are `0`.

Padding defaults to 20 — including the root, whose padding frames the whole scene (the
SVG margin) — with `|block|` / `|row|` / `|column|` at 0 and a `|table|` at `4 8` (its
cell inset). It doubles as the minimum size of an empty box (`2 × padding`; see
[Auto-sizing](#6-positioning--anchors)). **Every baked default — these constants and
the template bundles — lives in one place**, so the whole look is tuned from a single
file.

### 12.6 `--bake-vars`

Class rules and inline `style=` work everywhere, but CSS *variables* don't — resvg and
librsvg fail `var()` in every position (browsers, even `<img>`-embedded, are fine).
`--bake-vars` keeps the rules but inlines every `var(--lini-name)` as its literal: no
runtime theming, but a self-contained SVG that renders anywhere.

### 12.7 Expressions & functions

A **backtick expression** `` `…` `` holds compile-time math — folded to a literal (a
number, or a point `(x, y)` for geometry) when the diagram compiles. It is the **only
place operators appear**: outside a backtick `-` is a link, `<` / `>` are markers,
`/` a comment, so the fence is what lets `*` mean "times". A value stays backtick-free
until an operator does:

```
{ scale(n) `100 * 1.2^n`; }   // a function (below)

|box| {
  gap: 8;             // a literal
  width: scale(3);    // a call — no operator, no backtick
  padding: `8 * 2`;   // an operator → backtick (= 16)
}
```

Inside a backtick the language is small and total:

- **Operators** `+ - * / ^` (`^` power, right-associative), unary `-`, grouping `( )`,
  comparisons `< <= > >= == !=`, the ternary `cond ? a : b`.
- **Functions** — the math library `exp ln log sqrt abs sin cos tan min max clamp floor
  round pow`, and any you define (below); each returns a number or a point, called
  `name(args)`. (Colour / track builders like `rgb` / `repeat` make typed values, so
  they live in value position, never inside math.)
- **Constants** `pi`, `e`; **scientific notation** `1e6`, `1.32e-6`; the sample
  parameter `u` (geometry, below).
- **Locals** — `name = expr;` binds for the rest of the expression; the **final
  expression is the value** (no keyword, no `return`). `=` binds, `==` compares. Values
  are numbers and points — no strings, no loops.

```
`r = 40; n = 6; 2 * pi * r / n`   // r, n are locals; the last line is the value
```

**Functions** are defined in the stylesheet — a name, a parameter list, and a backtick
body, **juxtaposed** with no colon (which keeps a definition apart from a property:
`scale: …` is a property, `scale(n) …` a function). A zero-parameter function is a
named constant:

```
{
  scale(n)   `100 * 1.2^n`;
  unit()     `8`;                          // a named constant
  wave(a, f) `(u*300, a*sin(2*pi*f*u))`;   // a parametric point
}
```

Call a function anywhere a value goes — bare like `rgb(…)` / `repeat(…)`, or inside a
backtick; only an operator forces the fence, never the call, and a computed argument is
itself a backtick:

```
|box| { width: scale(3); padding: `scale(2) + 4`; columns: repeat(3, `80 * 2`) }
```

**Geometry.** `points:` (on `|line|` / `|poly|`) may be a **parametric expression in
`u`** — `u` sweeps `0 → 1`, sampled at `samples:` points into a vertex list, drawing
curves, waves, and spirals procedurally:

```
|line| { points: `(u*300, 20*sin(2*pi*3*u))`; samples: 60 }   // a sine wave
|line| { points: wave(20, 3); samples: 60 }                   // the same, named
```

Everything an expression touches **bakes** — a computed size, a sampled curve — so a
standalone SVG never depends on host CSS. Unknown names, wrong arity, and out-of-range
results are compile-time errors ([§16](#16-errors)).

## 13. Specificity

Properties on a node merge like CSS — **the more specific source wins**, ties broken by
**later wins** (source order):

1. **Type cascade** — walked from the base primitive up to the node's declared type,
   layering each type's element-rule (`|box| { }`) and define defaults. A more-derived
   type overrides what it builds on.
2. **Descendant rules** — `|table| |box| { }`, `.sidebar |box| { }`, matched against
   the ancestor chain.
3. **Class rules** — `.hot { }`, worn via `|box| .hot` on the node.
4. **Id rule** — `#hero { }`, the node's own id.
5. **The instance's own block** — `|box#client| { fill: white }` — the most specific,
   beats everything above.

For a link: cascaded `link*` / `clearance` / `routing` from its scope →
descendant/class/id rules → the link's own declarations.

Complex values (`translate: x y`, `padding: t r b l`) replace wholesale — the merge is
per-property, not deep. A `pin`ned child ignores `cell:` — pinning takes it out of the
grid.

## 14. SVG Output

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     viewBox="X Y W H" width="W" height="H" class="lini">
  <style>
    @layer lini.defaults {
      :root, .lini { color-scheme: light dark; /* --lini-*: light-dark(…, …) */ }
      .lini[data-theme="dark"],  [data-theme="dark"]  .lini { color-scheme: dark; }
      .lini[data-theme="light"], [data-theme="light"] .lini { color-scheme: light; }
    }
    .lini { font-family: var(--lini-font-family); font-size: 15px; font-weight: var(--lini-font-weight); color: var(--lini-text-color); }
    .lini .lini-canvas { fill: var(--lini-bg); }
    .lini .lini-box { fill: var(--lini-fill); stroke: var(--lini-stroke); stroke-width: 2; }
    .lini .lini-style-hot { stroke-width: 3; }   /* one rule per class def */
    .lini .lini-link { stroke: var(--lini-stroke); stroke-width: 2; fill: none; }
  </style>
  <defs><!-- filters, gradients, clipPaths --></defs>
  <rect class="lini-canvas" .../>   <!-- the scene background (--lini-bg) -->
  <g class="lini-scene"> <!-- scene tree --> </g>
  <g class="lini-links"> <!-- links --> </g>
</svg>
```

`viewBox` auto-sizes to content + the scene's `padding` (20 px by default) on every
side. The `lini-canvas` backing rect paints the scene background (`--lini-bg`) over the
viewBox; a root `fill:` overrides it (`none` = transparent).

**Paint compiles to CSS; geometry bakes.** Node and link paint defaults — and every
rule — are stated once as class rules; only the classes actually used are emitted — and
likewise only the `--lini-*` variables actually referenced, so the built-in palette
([§12.2](#122-the-colour-palette)) adds nothing unless a diagram uses it. A node whose
resolved paint differs from those rules carries the difference as an inline `style="…"`
(inline beats class, mirroring [Specificity](#13-specificity)). Geometry — sizes,
positions (`pin` and `translate` fold into the baked origin), radii, points, paths,
transforms — is always baked into attributes. Inherited text properties (`font-family`,
`font-size`, `font-weight`, `color`, and any global `font-style` / `text-transform` /
`text-decoration`) state on `.lini` and cascade natively; a node's own text property
emits on its `<g>` (or directly on the `<text>`) and inherits to its subtree.

**Box:**

```svg
<g class="lini-node lini-{type} lini-{base} lini-style-{class}"
   data-id="ID" transform="translate(X,Y)">
  <title>…</title>            <!-- when `title:` is set -->
  <!-- geometry, then children -->
</g>
```

Auto-classes: `lini-node` (every box); `lini-{name}` (the type and every type it
inherits, down to `lini-block`); `lini-style-{name}` (per worn class). With rotation,
the transform becomes `translate(X,Y) rotate(N)`.

**Text** emits a bare `<text class="lini-text">…</text>` at its placed position — no
wrapping `<g>`, so a table of N cells is N `<text>` elements, not N boxes. Its font and
colour come by inheritance from the enclosing `<g>`; a string's own style block emits as
a `style="…"` (and `translate` / `rotate` as a `transform`) on the `<text>` itself.

**Link:**

```svg
<g class="lini-link lini-style-{class}" data-from="A" data-to="B">
  <path d="…" fill="none" stroke="…"/>
  <polygon class="lini-marker lini-marker-arrow" …/>
  <text class="lini-text" …>label</text>   <!-- placed by along: -->
</g>
```

Host CSS may restyle any `lini-`-prefixed class; layout is computed at compile time, so
runtime restyling (a fatter `stroke-width`) restyles without re-layout.

## 15. CLI

```
lini [options] <input.lini>
lini fmt [--check] [--stdout] <input.lini>
lini desugar <input.lini>
lini serve [--port N] [--bake-vars] [PATH]
lini theme [NAME]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o FILE` | Output path (default stdout). |
| `--format svg\|html` | `svg` (default) or HTML wrapper. |
| `--check` | Parse + resolve only — layout/render errors still surface on a full compile. |
| `--theme NAME\|FILE\|A/B` | A built-in theme (`dark`, `high-contrast`, …), a CSS file of `--lini-*` overrides, or a light/dark pair (`light/dark`). |
| `--no-warn` / `--strict` | Silence warnings / treat them as errors. |
| `--bake-vars` | Inline `var()`s as literals (for non-browser renderers). |
| `--watch` | Recompile on every input change (requires `-o`). |
| `-h`, `-V` | Help / version. |

`lini -` reads stdin (filename `<stdin>` in errors). **`lini serve`** runs a local live
preview (default port 7700): a `.lini` file live-reloads that one file; a directory (or
no path → the current directory) opens the **playground** — pick, edit, and render any
`.lini` file beneath it in the browser. **`lini theme`** lists the built-in themes;
**`lini theme NAME`** prints one as a `--lini-*` CSS file — a ready starting point for
your own (`light-dark()` colours, the font commented out).

**`lini fmt`** reformats to canonical style — 2-space indent, `key: value;`
declarations grouped on one line, a style-only node collapsed onto its head line when it
fits (`|box#api| { fill: red }`), a lone label trailing the head (`|box#api| "API"`),
children one per line in `[ ]`, table cells padded into aligned columns, comments and
blank lines preserved. `--check` exits 1 if it would change anything; `--stdout` writes
instead of rewriting.

**`lini desugar`** prints the file fully **lowered to primitives** — every
template/define instance becomes its base `|block|` (etc.) wearing a `.lini-*` class
chain, each type's defaults become a generated `.lini-<type> { … }` class, the scene and
cascaded link defaults fill the global block, define bodies inline per instance, and
the per-type smart label, auto-`along:`, and link auto-create (an undeclared endpoint `x` becomes `|box#x| "x"`) become explicit. It is the
engine's true input — the rest of the pipeline only ever sees primitives, and the
lowered form re-renders byte-identically. A teaching/debugging view; prints to stdout,
never rewrites, comments not preserved.

Exit codes: 0 success · 1 parse/resolution error or `--check` reformat needed · 2 I/O ·
3 invalid CLI.

| Invalid `oklch()` | `oklch expects (L, C, H) or (L, C, H, A) — L and A in 0..1, C ≥ 0, H in degrees` |
| Gradient with < 2 stops | `gradient() needs at least two colour stops` |
| `linear-gradient` without an angle | `linear-gradient needs an angle first, then ≥ 2 colour stops` |
| Unknown side | `':X' is not a side — use top, bottom, left, or right` |
| `\|link\|` / `\|node\|` as instance | `links are drawn by operators, not the '\|link\|' type` / `'node' is the umbrella concept — write '\|block\|' for the bare box` |
| Grid out of range | `cell: 5 _ exceeds columns=3` |
| Grid props off a grid | `'cell' is valid only on a grid` |
| Missing `columns` | `'layout: grid' requires 'columns'` |

**Single-pass LL(1).** The stylesheet-first rule plus the bracket-and-bars vocabulary make
one token of lookahead enough — and the first token of every statement already tells its
kind:

- In the stylesheet, `|…|` → a rule or (with an inner `::`) a define, `.name` → a class
  rule, `#name` → an id rule, `--name :` → a variable, `ident :` → a root declaration.
- After it, a drawn statement is a `node` (`|…|`) or `text` (`"…"`), or — when a bare
  `ident` is followed by a link-op, `&`, or a `.` path — a `link`; the two interleave in
  source order, which a `layout: sequence` reads as time ([§10](#10-sequences)).
- `|…|` is always identity, `{` always style, `[` always content. A string heads the
  one inline label (or, with no preceding identity, a free-standing text node); two or
  more labels ride the `[ ]`.
- A **declaration** ends with `;` (its value runs to the `;`, so it may span lines); a
  **statement** (node, link, text) ends at a newline or `;`. In the stylesheet, a name
  followed by `(`…`)` and a backtick body is a **function definition** ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)), not a declaration.

**Adjacency tells a `.class` from a path; a `:` tells a side.** A space before the `.`
makes it a worn class (`a .hot` — node `a` with class `hot`), no space makes it an
endpoint path (`a.b`). The first class is spaced from the identity/endpoints; the rest
of the chain glues (`.hot.loud`). A glued `|box.hot|` in the bars is rejected — a class
follows the bars ([§16](#16-errors)). A `:` after an endpoint forces a side (`a:left`),
distinct from the declaration `:` by position. `#` heads an id in the bars or at a rule
head; with hex digits in a *value* it is a colour.

No prescan, no second pass, no "define before use" needed for *parsing* (it is still
required for the resolve-time cascade — [§18](#18-implementer-algorithm)).

---

## 18. Implementer Algorithm

A reference pipeline; implementations may differ if the observable output matches.

**Parse.** Lex to tokens, then a single recursive-descent pass to the AST. The
bracket-and-bars vocabulary (`|…|` identity, `{ }` style, `[ ]` content) resolves every
statement with one token of lookahead — no type-set prescan.

**Desugar.** Lower all surface sugar to primitives + classes — the engine's true input.
Each template/define instance becomes its base primitive wearing a `.lini-*` class
chain (derived→base→primitive, down to `block` for every rectangular type); a type's
defaults and any `|type| { }` element rule fold into a generated `.lini-<type> { … }`
class; a `|table| |box| { }` descendant rule rewrites to `.lini-table .lini-box { }`;
define bodies inline per instance; the scene defaults (`layout`, `padding`, `gap`,
`font-size`) and the cascaded link defaults (`link`, `link-width`, `clearance`,
`routing`) settle on the root; the per-type smart label (text / caption /
symbol / link label), auto-`along:`, and link auto-create (an undeclared
endpoint `x` → `|box#x| "x"`) become explicit. The pass
is idempotent; type-system errors (cycle, depth > 16, a define shadowing a built-in)
surface here.

**Resolve** (top-to-bottom):

1. *Variables, functions & rules:* merge visual-var defaults ← `--theme` ←
   `--name: value`; build the function table; compile the stylesheet's class / id /
   element / descendant rules. Backtick expressions and function calls fold to literal
   numbers / points ([§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)).
2. *Scene tree:* each box is a primitive wearing `.lini-*` (type) and user classes;
   layer properties per [Specificity](#13-specificity) — the worn `.lini-*` classes as
   the type tier (folded base→derived), then descendant rules, class rules, the id rule,
   and the instance block; lift internal links; build the path index. (Types, labels,
   define bodies, and auto-create were all lowered by **Desugar**.)
3. *Links:* resolve endpoints by scoped path walk with suggestion errors; merge link
   properties — cascaded `link*` / `clearance` / `routing` from the scope chain, then
   class/id rules, then the link's own block; cartesian-expand fan groups into one
   resolved link per pair; the operator's line sets `link-style` unless overridden.

**Layout** (bottom-up): leaf bbox from `width`/`height` or defaults (text → its glyphs;
box → content + `padding`; + half-`stroke-width` per side); arrange flow children per
`layout` / `direction` honouring `align`/`justify`/`stretch`/`evenly` when there is slack; pin
out-of-flow children to their parent anchor (the parent never grows for them); compute
dividers; apply `padding`; apply each node's `translate`; `rotate` last.

**Route links.** Per [`LINKING.md`](LINKING.md) — orthogonal, clearance-respecting,
deterministic. Place markers (sized `max(5, link-width × 4)`, tip on the endpoint) and
link labels at their `along:` fractions (auto-distributed when unset).

**Render.** Depth-first emit SVG per [SVG Output](#14-svg-output): a box is a `<g>`, a
string is a `<text>`.

---

## 19. Reserved Words

Because a type only ever appears in bars (`|box|`) and an id always wears a `#`, **type
names are free as ids and ids are free as type names** — `|block#oval|` is fine, and
`block -> oval` is two ordinary nodes. A small set of words stays reserved:

- **`node`, `link`,** and the structural class names **`text`, `marker`, `canvas`,
  `scene`, `links`, `cut`:** not instantiable types — `node` is the umbrella concept (write
  `|block|` for the bare box), links are drawn by operators (`|link|` is an error), and
  a define may not take one of these (its generated `.lini-<name>` would collide with a
  built-in SVG class).

The **`.lini-*` class prefix** is reserved: desugar generates the type classes
(`.lini-block`, `.lini-box`, `.lini-<define>`), so a user class may not begin `lini-`.
User classes are emitted `.lini-style-<name>`.

The side names **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`** are **not** reserved — they are
keywords only after an endpoint's `:` (`a:left`), so a node may be named `|box#left|`.

Single quotes (`'`) are reserved and are not strings.

Value keywords are **contextual**, not reserved as ids — `flow`, `grid`, `sequence`, `row`,
`column`, `start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch`, `evenly`, `none`, `auto`, `orthogonal` mean
their keyword only after the property that expects them (`layout: sequence`, `direction: row`,
`routing: orthogonal`). The sequence frame / note type names (`loop`, `opt`, `alt`, `else`,
`note`, [§10](#10-sequences)) are built-in types like `box` / `chart` — protected from a
define shadowing them, free as ids. Function names `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `repeat` are reserved
only before `(`.

Inside an expression (a backtick region, [§12.7](#127-expressions--functions)), `pi`,
`e`, and the sample parameter `u` are keywords, and the math-function names (`sin`,
`exp`, `min`, …) are reserved before `(` — all contextual to the expression, free as
ids elsewhere.

---

## 20. Deferred

**Deferred** — named in the language, not built yet; the syntax is stable:

- `routing: straight` / `routing: curved` — non-orthogonal link strategies
  ([§9](#9-links); `orthogonal` is the only mode built today).
- **sequence fragments beyond `loop` / `opt` / `alt`** — `par` (parallel, with an `|and|`
  separator), `break`, `critical`; plus create / destroy lifelines, explicit activation
  spans, message auto-numbering, and an `|actor|` stick-figure primitive (an actor is
  `|icon|` today) ([§10](#10-sequences)).
- `stroke-style: wavy` rendering on nodes.
- **gradient fills on text** — `fill: gradient(…)` on a label (gradients fill nodes
  today, [§12.3](#123-gradients)).
- `radius` on non-rect primitives (hex / diamond / slant / poly).
- numeric `font-weight` (`100…900`).
- a solid (`fill`-weight) icon variant — the built-in icon set is **Phosphor** duotone,
  drawn as paths ([§7](#7-nodes)), behind the default-on `icons` feature.
- embedded font metrics — the monospace default keeps the estimate close; a proportional
  `font-family` override is approximate until then.
- `aria-label`, and a "did you mean" property-name hint table.
